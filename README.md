apisix-authz is an authorization plugin for APISIX based on [lua-casbin](https://github.com/casbin/lua-casbin/).

## Installation

Ensure you have Casbin's system dependencies installed by:
```
sudo apt install gcc libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
```

Install Casbin's latest release (currently v1.16.1) from LuaRocks by:
```
sudo luarocks install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/casbin/lua-casbin/master/casbin-1.16.1-1.rockspec
```

Then clone this repo and copy the `apisix-authz.lua` file to your plugin directory (modify the plugin according to your situation if you wish to):
```
git clone https://github.com/casbin-lua/apisix-authz
cp apisix-authz/apisix-authz.lua path_to_apisix/plugins/apisix-authz.lua
```

And finally append the plugins section of your `conf/config.yaml` with `apisix-authz` to something like this (more on this [here](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/docs/en/latest/plugin-develop.md#:~:text=To%20enable%20your%20plugin%2C%20copy%20this%20plugin%20list%20into%20conf/config.yaml%2C%20and%20add%20your%20plugin%20name.%20For%20instance%3A)):
```
plugins:                          # plugin list
...
  - apisix-authz
```

## Configuration

You can add this plugin globally or on any route/service by sending a request through the Admin API. For example, for adding it to some route:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/*",
    "plugins": {
        "apisix-authz": {
            "model_path": "/path/to/model_path.conf",
            "policy_path": "/path/to/policy_path.csv",
            "username": "user"
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "example.com": 1
        }
    }
}'

```

For adding this globally:
```
curl -X PUT \
  https://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/global_rules/1 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' \
  -d '{
        "plugins": {
            "apisix-authz": {
                "model_path": "/path/to/model_path.conf",
                "policy_path": "/path/to/policy_path.csv",
                "username": "user"
            }
        }
    }'
```

<table><thead>

</tbody></table>

As per the current configuration, if the request is authorized, the execution will proceed normally. While if it is not authorized, it will return "Access Denied" message with the 403 exit code and stop any further execution.

## Development

If you wish to customize this according to your scenario, you can do so by customizing the apisix-authz.lua file from your plugins directory.

## Documentation

The authorization determines a request based on `{subject, object, action}`, which means what `subject` can perform what `action` on what `object`. In this plugin, the meanings are:
1. `subject`: the logged-in username as passed in the header
2. `object`: the URL path for the web resource like "dataset1/item1"
3. `action`: HTTP method like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or the high-level actions you defined like "read-file", "write-blog"
For how to write authorization policy and other details, please refer to the [Casbin's documentation](https://casbin.org/).

## Example

An example of policy file and model file is given in the [examples](https://github.com/casbin-lua/apisix-authz/tree/master/examples) directory of this repo. 

The example model file is:
```
[request_definition]
r = sub, obj, act

[policy_definition]
p = sub, obj, act

[role_definition]
g = _, _

[policy_effect]
e = some(where (p.eft == allow))

[matchers]
m = (g(r.sub, p.sub) || keyMatch(r.sub, p.sub)) && keyMatch(r.obj, p.obj) && keyMatch(r.act, p.act)
```

And the example policy file is:
```
p, *, /, GET
p, admin, *, *
g, alice, admin
```

This means that all users can access the homepage `/` but only users with admin permissions like alice can access other pages and other HTTP request methods.

Now if you send a request (using the example model/policy files) as:
```
curl http://127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes/1 -H 'X-API-KEY: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1' -X PUT -d '
{
    "uri": "/*",
    "plugins": {
        "apisix-authz": {
            "model_path": "/path/to/authz_model.conf",
            "policy_path": "/path/to/authz_policy.csv",
            "username": "user"
        }
    },
    "upstream": {
        "type": "roundrobin",
        "nodes": {
            "example.com": 1
        }
    },
    "host": "example.com"
}'
```

This will configure model and policy on this route on all URIs (`/*`). Now if you send a request for the first time as:
```
curl -i -X GET \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:9080/ \
  --header 'user: anonymous' \
  --header 'host: example.com'
```

When run for the first time, it will create a Casbin Enforcer using the model path and policy path. If this returns a 200 (OK) status code, then the configuration is good to go otherwise please check the error.log file in your logs directory of APISIX.

But if you the send request as:
```
curl -i -X POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:9080/ \
  --header 'user: anonymous' \
  --header 'host: example.com'
```
This will result in a 403 error, since as per the policy configuration any non-admin user can not use any non-GET request methods. If you change the 'user' header to alice, this will be an authorized request then.
